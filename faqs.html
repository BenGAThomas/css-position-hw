        <p><strong>What is GameFAQs?</strong></p>
            <p>GameFAQs, once known as the Video Game FAQ Archive, is an archive of FAQs, move lists, walkthroughs, codes, 
            and other hints and tips for Arcade, Computer, and Home Video games. It first came online on November 5, 1995, 
            and has been dutifully serving the Internet gaming community ever since. </p>
        <p><strong>What's a FAQ?</strong></p>
             <p>In case you haven't been paying attention, FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions. Basically, a FAQ is a list of the most commonly asked questions about a game, 
                    usually along with a lot of uncommonly asked questions, trivia, in-depth information, and more. </p>
        <p><strong>Did you write all of these?</strong></p>
             <p>You've got to be kidding (in other words, no). The files on GameFAQs were written by over 1,000 different authors at last count. Each file is fully owned by the author of that file,
                    and the author has full legal control over its use and distribution. GameFAQs is just a highly organized storage space - nothing more.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you have a FAQ/walkthrough/hints/codes about (insert game here)?</strong></p>
            <p>If it's not on the site, no. Please remember that I didn't write all of these FAQs, and I rarely break down and write one myself. If you need information about a particular game, use the Request form.</p>
        <p><strong>When will you have a FAQ/walkthrough/hints/codes for (insert game here)?</strong></p>
            <p>As soon as someone writes one. The best thing for you to do is use the Request form - a lot of FAQ authors do notice the request list (even a lot of people who have never written before), and are usually quick to help out!</p>
        <p><strong>When is (insert game here) coming out?</strong></p>
            <p>I don't know. Ask you local game retailer, or contact the company that's releasing the game. A good source of upcoming game releases is Electronics Boutique, who post their release lists (the same one their stores get) on their web site. </p>
        <p><strong>Where can I buy (insert game here)?</strong></p>
            <p>Try your local retailer. If that doesn't work, pick up a computer or video gaming magazine - most have many advertisers that are more than happy to take your order! </p>
        <p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Linking to and from GameFAQs</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Can I link to your site?</strong></p>
            <p>Sure! Just as long as you follow the rules below:
                <ol>
                    <li>Web sites have permission to link to any HTML or ASP page on the GameFAQs web site. I'd prefer it if you linked to the top page of GameFAQs (http://www.gamefaqs.com) where possible, 
                        but any link to a page ending in ".html" or ".asp" is acceptable. The linked page may not be placed in a frame from your (or any other) web site.</li>
                    <li>Web sites may only link to individual text files (FAQs, walkthroughs, etc.) on GameFAQs with prior permission of GameFAQs, and a separate link to the GameFAQs home page must be provided 
                        immediately after the link to the text file. The linked page may not be placed in a frame from your (or any other) web site.</li>
                    <li>Exception to the above two rules: FAQ authors may link to any text file that they have authored in whole or part with no restrictions or prior permission required.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        <p><strong>Can I link to your FAQs?</strong></p>
            <p>See #2 above. Of course, I'd prefer it if you linked to HTML pages on the site - this way, you can present the full range of information available for the game, and GameFAQs itself is promoted as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I take FAQs from the site and put them on my site?</strong></p>
            <p>That's not my call. Each FAQ is owned and copyrighted solely by its author(s), and each file contains different restrictions on its use. Either read and follow the notice in the FAQ itself (if there is one), 
                or contact the FAQ author for explicit permission. </p>
        <p><strong>I have a cool site. Will you link to my site?</strong></p>
            <p>No. GameFAQs does not have a "link" section, and there are no plans to offer one. Alternatively, FAQ authors may have an Author page created for themselves, and that can (and usually does) contain a link to their home page. </p>
        <p style="font-size:30px"><strong>The Administrative Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Who runs GameFAQs?</strong></p>
                <p>Me. GameFAQs is operated by Jeff "CJayC" Veasey, who handles submissions, artwork, HTML, scripting, and basically everything involved in the day-to-day maintenance of the site. The FAQs themselves have been contributed by thousands of 
                different authors over the past several years - I don't own those, I just store them.</p>
        <p><strong>What is your affiliation with Imagine?</strong></p>
            <p>GameFAQs is an affiliate site of the Imagine Games Network, a group of independently owned and operated fan sites under a common banner. </p>
        <p><strong>What is your affiliation with Secrets of the Sega Sages?</strong></p>
            <p>GameFAQs and SegaSages share links between the sites, in a mutually beneficial arrangement. SegaSages links to FAQs here, and GameFAQs links to codes there. </p>
        <p><strong>Aren't you just making money off of other people's work?</strong></p>
            <p>Nope. I'm not running GameFAQs for a profit, but for the fun of it. Believe it or not, all money gained from advertisements is funneled right back into the site in the form of server fees, Internic fees, access fees, software for managing the site, 
                hardware, and other expenses. Like most of the FAQ authors, I'm in this just for the fame and glory. </p>
        <p><strong>Do people really ask you these questions?</strong></p>
            <p>With the exception of this one, yes. Each one of these is an actual question one or more people have asked in the past few months alone. </p>
